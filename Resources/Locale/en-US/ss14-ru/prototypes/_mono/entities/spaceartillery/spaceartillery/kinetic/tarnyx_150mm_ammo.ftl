ent-ShipTarnyxProjectile = TARNYX 150mm EMP projectile
    .desc = { ent-BaseBulletTrigger.desc }
ent-150mmEmpShell = 150mm EMP shell
    .desc = A chemically-propelled EMP shell, used in 150mm cannons such as the TARNYX. Nothing fancy.
ent-ShipTarnyxApProjectile = TARNYX 150mm AP projectile
    .desc = { ent-BaseBulletTrigger.desc }
ent-150mmApShell = 150mm AP shell
    .desc = A chemically-propelled AP shell for 150mm cannons. Its not very good, as most 150mm cannons are optimized for EMP shells. Its a crude method, and it certainly wouldn't pass a TSFN inspection.
